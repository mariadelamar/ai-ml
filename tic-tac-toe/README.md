# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against an AI opponent. I originally created this project to learn more about AI, and let's just say, the first version of the AI was... well, not very smart. In fact, I won every time. But now? The AI has leveled up, and I haven't been able to beat it since! So, if you're looking for a challenge, this game might just be a bit too smart for its own good.
